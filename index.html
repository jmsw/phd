<center><h2>[Under Construction] Some Common Questions About my Ph.D. Project</h2>

<button class="collapsible">What is my project about?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>My project is about Isabella Beeton, who wrote a very famous cookbook in London in 1861 called the <i>Book of Household Management</i>. 
    She died very young, at age 28. 
    Although a lot of people think of her as a stereotypical Victorian domestic expert, based on the reputation of her cookbook, that is not the whole story. 
    <br><br>
    She was also a writer and editor for The <i>Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</i>, which was the first secular women's magazine in Britain.
    By tracking down previously hard-to-find copies of her magazine work, and looking closely at what she wrote, my project tells a more complete story of her remarkable working life.  
    <br><br>
    The project also looks closely at the kinds of questions that everyday women readers at the time (the late 1850s and early 1860s in Britain) would write in to the magazine about. 
    I located, transcribed, and analyzed all of the correspondence material from the magazine between 1857-1861, the period when Isabella Beeton was also writing the book that would make her famous.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, I look at the ways that the periodical press at the time parallels our current information age, and some ways that both historic magazines and modern social media have changed the way people read, think, and collaborate. 
    <br><br></p>

<button class="collapsible">Why did you pick this magazine to write about?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>I've always found historic magazines interesting. 
    The <i>Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</i> was the first secular women's magazine in Britain.
    As such, it can show us what many women at the time were interested in, not just in novels or stories, but in their everyday lives.
    It was priced very low, at just 2d (twopence) per month, so many people could afford it. 
    At its height, there were over 60,000 copies in circulation each month.
    <br><br>
    Its founders really cared about getting useful and interesting information into the hands of the reading public. 
    They worked hard to find a mix of material that would appeal to readers at the time, and included a lot about everyday life back then that makes for fascinating reading today.
    <br><br>
    I also picked it because in my opinion for how influential it was, and how famous its "Editress" was in other ways, I felt it had seen too little scholarly inquiry, mostly because of it being difficult to locate before digitized copies became more widely available.

<button class="collapsible">What was in a typical issue of this magazine?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The <i>Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</i> was always concerned with pleasing their audience.
    They ran on small profit margins and had to keep subscribers happy.
    Readers wrote in all the time with complaints and suggestions (a little bit like internet comments now!). 
    <br><br>
    A typical issue (or <b>number</b>, in the language of periodicals) might include: 
    <ul>
        <li>A cover with a table of contents</li>
        <li>Advertising inside the cover</li>
        <li>An illustration or fashion plate engraving - the EDM was one of the first to include these</li>
        <li>Some fiction -- ofthen this was "serialized" which means you would get one section or chapter of a larger book each month. This would keep subscribers loyal, and also allowed them to read longer works at a time when books were still prohibitively expensive for many.
        <li>Poems</li>
        <li>Articles about historical topics or current events</li>
        <li>Entertaining material like jokes or funny anecdotes.</li>
        <li>Patterns for a craft: for example, woolwork, needlepoint or lace making</li>
        <li>A description of the latest fashions (usually from Paris), and how to emulate them</li>
        <li>Recipes for dishes in season at the time of year</li>
        <li>Household tips for cleaning, health, animals and pets</li>
        <li>Correspondence: Questions submitted, with answers from the editors, or other readers</li>
        <li>More advertising inside the back cover and on the back cover itself.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

<button class="collapsible">Next Question</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Well, for a long time, the only way to read them was either to own some of them, or to find them in special collections in a library. <br><br>
    The problem is that no libraries, even huge ones, like the British Library in London, have a complete set, and the copies that did exist online were really difficult to accurately label and put in order. 
    (This is because the magazine started over with its numbering twice.)  
    <br><br>
    However, as part of this project, I read through and organized all the known online copies, and created a chronological index. 
    <br><br>
    <a href="https://jmsw.github.io/edm-index/" target="_blank"><b>You can read that here.</b></a> By clicking on any of the links to the right of a date, you will go directly to an online digitized copy of the magazine from that date.
